The 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge: A Holiday Odyssey
Featuring 6: Geese A-Lei'ing!

Welcome to this year's SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! We can't wait for you to
hop in the game and share some holiday cheer as you build vital cybersecurity
skills.

This year, Santa and the elves have moved to an island archipelago near the
equator in the Pacific Ocean. On these Geese Islands, Santa's team is using a
new Artificial Intelligence tool called ChatNPT to prepare for the annual
gift-giving extravaganza. The elves need your help in making sure that they
apply ChatNPT appropriately. To that end, we recommend that you set up and use
your own free account in OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, or Microsoft's Bing
AI tools to help you solve challenges while learning vital cybersecurity
lessons.

And, one last thing -- As you engage with our North Pole team and other
players, remember to always treat them with kindness and respect following the
Holiday Hack Challenge Code of Conduct and Terms of Use.

Once you've read that code and agree to it, feel free to sign in. Also, please
join us on Discord to chat with other players and the Holiday Hack team.

Happy Holidays from the entire SANS Holiday Hack Challenge team!
